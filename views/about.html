        Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman
        who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002
        and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s
        when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq
        Computers. Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a
        rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International
        Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity
        in 2016, and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on
        an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's
        administration.
