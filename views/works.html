        <h3 class="text-left">Zip2 Corporation</h3>
        <p>
          Musk launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his
          brother, Kimbal Musk. An online city guide, Zip2 was soon providing
          content for the new websites of both The New York Times and the
          Chicago Tribune. In 1999, a division of Compaq Computer Corporation
          bought Zip2 for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options.

        <h3 class="text-left">PayPal</h3>
        <p>
          In 1999, Elon and Kimbal Musk used the money from their sale of Zip2
          to found X.com, an online financial services/payments company. An
          X.com acquisition the following year led to the creation of PayPal as
          it is known today.
          <br /><br />
          In October 2002, Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was
          acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. Before the sale, Musk
          owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.

        <h3 class="text-left">SpaceX</h3>
        <p>
          Musk founded his third company, Space Exploration Technologies
          Corporation, or SpaceX, in 2002 with the intention of building
          spacecraft for commercial space travel. By 2008, SpaceX was well
          established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo
          transport for the International Space Station—with plans for astronaut
          transport in the future—in a move to replace NASA’s own space shuttle
          missions.

        <h3 class="text-left">Tesla Motors</h3>
        <p>
          Musk is the co-founder, CEO and product architect at Tesla Motors, a
          company formed in 2003 that is dedicated to producing affordable,
          mass-market electric cars as well as battery products and solar roofs.
          Musk oversees all product development, engineering and design of the
          company's products.

        <h3 class="text-left">SolarCity</h3>
        <p>
          In August 2016, in Musk’s continuing effort to promote and advance
          sustainable energy and products for a wider consumer base, a $2.6
          billion dollar deal was solidified to combine his electric car and
          solar energy companies. His Tesla Motors Inc. announced an all-stock
          deal purchase of SolarCity Corp., a company Musk had helped his
          cousins start in 2006. He is a majority shareholder in each entity.
          “Solar and storage are at their best when they're combined. As one
          company, Tesla (storage) and SolarCity (solar) can create fully
          integrated residential, commercial and grid-scale products that
          improve the way that energy is generated, stored and consumed,” read a
          statement on Tesla’s website about the deal.

        <h3 class="text-left">The Boring Company</h3>
        <p>
          In January 2017, Musk launched The Boring Company, a company devoted
          to boring and building tunnels in order to reduce street traffic. He
          began with a test dig on the SpaceX property in Los Angeles. In late
          October of that year, Musk posted the first photo of his company's
          progress to his Instagram page. He said the 500-foot tunnel, which
          would generally run parallel to Interstate 405, would reach a length
          of two miles in approximately four months. In May 2019 the company,
          now known as TBC, landed a $48.7 million contract from the Las Vegas
          Convention and Visitors Authority to build an underground Loop system
          to shuttle people around the Las Vegas Convention Center.
